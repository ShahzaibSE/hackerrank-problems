    "# Graph Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A **graph** is a data structure consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertices (nodes):** Represent entities (e.g., people, places).\n",
    "- **Edges (links):** Represent connections/relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are widely used to model real-world scenarios, such as social networks, maps, or web pages.\n",

    "## Key Concepts for Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Graph Representations**\n",
    "- Understand the difference between:\n",
    "  - **Adjacency List:** Space-efficient for sparse graphs; stores a list of neighbors for each vertex.\n",
    "  - **Adjacency Matrix:** Faster edge lookups; uses more space, especially for dense graphs.\n",
    "- **Trade-offs:** Choose based on the problem and the graph's density.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Graph Traversals**\n",
    "- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n",
    "  - Explores the graph layer by layer.\n",
    "  - Useful for solving problems like shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n",
    "- **Depth-First Search (DFS):**\n",
    "  - Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.\n",
    "  - Used for problems like cycle detection, connected components, and puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Graph Algorithms**\n",
    "- **Shortest Path Algorithms:**\n",
    "  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds shortest path in weighted graphs (non-negative weights).\n",
    "  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Handles graphs with negative weights.\n",
    "  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Computes shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.\n",
    "- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):**\n",
    "  - **Kruskal’s Algorithm:** Edge-based approach using sorting and union-find.\n",
    "  - **Prim’s Algorithm:** Starts from a vertex and grows the MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Graph Properties**\n",
    "- **Graph Coloring:** Assign colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n",
    "- **Bipartite Graphs:** Can be colored with two colors; used in scheduling and matching problems.\n",
    "- **Graph Connectivity:**\n",
    "  - Check if the graph is connected (all vertices are reachable).\n",
    "  - Identify strongly connected components in directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Advanced Topics**\n",
    "- **Topological Sorting:** Linear ordering of vertices for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs); used in task scheduling.\n",
    "- **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs):** Subgraphs where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex; identified using Kosaraju's or Tarjan's algorithm.\n",
    "- **Network Flow:**\n",
    "  - Solve problems like maximum flow in a network.\n",
    "  - Algorithms: Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are a cornerstone of many algorithms and data structure problems. Mastering their representations, traversals, properties, and advanced algorithms is crucial for technical interviews.\n"
